## Does R Work?

```{r}
str(iris)
```

- Yep

## Does Python work?

```{python}
#| include: false
import sys
print(sys.executable)
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')
iris.info()
```

- Yep, it does. Note jupyter argument in YAML, installing jupyter, jupyter-cache, etc, in venv, and execute daemon: false
- Also note that it is the `.Renviron` file that is setting the path to `QUARTO_PYTHON`, not `_environment`. Not even sure what `_environment` is doing.
- We also need complete file paths apparently, not relative to project

## Plot

```{python}
sns.boxplot(data = iris)
```
